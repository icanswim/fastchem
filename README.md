Quantum datasets, models and learners for machine learning; implemented in pytorch and fastai.

environment.yml includes fastai requirements.

see quantum_experiment.ipynb for examples.

TODO:  inference, combining datasets, more models (lstm, mpnn, transformer, ensemble), fastai implementations

TODO:  experiment.  to what extent is a model able to learn
actual quantum mechanical mechanisms?  lit search.  compare models. test on out-of-sample data
(hold out molecules by size, structure, composition, ect). identify 
archetypes.  examine errors by type and class.   

TODO:  experiment.  make  champs competition submissions with augmented and unaugmented data
and various model types.

TODO:  more dataset classes

TODO:  tool for visualizing/assessing model perimeter distributions
