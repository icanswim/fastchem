## An exploration of the state of the art in the use of  
# machine learning in the modeling of molecular quantum mechanics.

## Datasets, models and learners for machine learning; implemented in pytorch.

pytorch = 1.6 cuda = 10.1

see fastchem_setup.txt for implementation notes.

see quantum_experiment.ipynb for examples.

### TODO message passing network, encoder/decoder, embeddings, attention
